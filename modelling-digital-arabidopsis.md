Figure 2: Updating the Carbon Dynamic Model (CDM). (a) The fraction of net assimilate partitioned to starch in plants grown under different photoperiods, as simulated in FMv1 using the 'overflow' concept (Overflow, blue diamonds), calculated based on measured starch levels (Gibon et al. 2009) (starch accumulation, orange) and calculated based on measured AGPase activity normalised to the value in 12:12D (AGPase activity, yellow). The regression line with equation inset is for the AGPase activity series. Triangles show the values calculated from measured starch levels in experiments under 12L:12D (Experiment 1, grey; Experiment 2, blue; Experiment 3 not shown, 7% lower than Experiment 2), reflected in the value of model parameter ss\_efficiency (Supporting Information Table 1). (b) Schematic of the updated Carbon Dynamic Model (CDM). The second carbon store represents the total amount of malate and fumarate. The clock symbol represents the regulation of the rate of starch consumption by the circadian clock model. Red/blue arrows indicate day-/night-specific processes. Dashed arrows indicate information or feedback input.
