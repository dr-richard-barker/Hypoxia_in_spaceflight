Pretty much all life on Earth — from flowers, to trees, to animals and humans — in large part owe their entire existence to one microscopic protein. It's called RuBisCO, and it's an enzyme: a biological machine that helps turn CO2 into energy. Of the millions of enzymes that exist on Earth, RuBisCO might be the most important.

[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=28s)

It's essential to photosynthesis, and without it plants would be unable to grow. Without RuBisCO, nearly all life on Earth would starve. But even though it's everywhere,  and it's been around for billions of years, RuBisCO is kind of terrible at its job. And it's getting worse as the world gets hotter.

[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=53s)

That's what brought me to MIT, where a team of scientists are trying to accomplish something that evolution has previously failed to do: To build a better RuBisCO. Rubisco was discovered kind of by accident. It was the 1940s, and an aimless grad student named Sam Wildman stumbled upon this newly released  book about plant science. The book described a simple way to get protein from leaves using common ingredients at the time.

[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=83s)

Curious, and maybe a bit bored, Sam started messing around in the lab. He realized that when he added a certain chemical to this spinach juice, this giant mysterious cloud of protein would appear. He didn't know it at the time, but that cloud was RuBisCO. He had just discovered the enzyme directly responsible for taking CO2 from the air and kickstarting photosynthesis.

[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=111s)

He also had no idea that that cloudy test tube contained a clue that would haunt scientists for the next eight decades. You can think of photosynthesis kind of like a big assembly line, that takes in CO2, and step by step, turns it into food. All these stops on the assembly line? These are enzymes.

[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=139s)

They're little biological machines that each perform a step in the process. And if they can work together, plants can suck up a lot of carbon, make a lot of food, and the whole operation runs like clockwork. Unfortunately, that's not what happens, because of this one incompetent enzyme right here: RuBisCO. The first problem is that it's really slow. We're talking like hundreds of times slower than many other enzymes.

[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=165s)

And it ends up slowing down the  entire factory, resulting in a lot less food. Second, it makes a lot of mistakes, especially when it's hot out. Instead of grabbing CO2, it'll often grab an oxygen molecule. And this wreaks havoc on the entire assembly line. The entire operation has to shut down and go into cleanup mode.

[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=188s)

This happens so often that plants waste nearly a third of their energy fixing this  sloppy mistake. This means that as climate change warms our planet, our farms will likely produce less food and our plants will get worse at sequestering carbon. In the face of all of these  problems, plants have developed an incredible makeshift workaround: they just make tons and tons of RuBisCO.

[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=216s)

This is why there was so much of that cloudy protein in Sam Wildman's test tube. RuBisCO alone makes up nearly half of the protein in the leaves of spinach and many other plants. Soon after its discovery, scientists started to wonder whether a better RuBisCO was possible. They envisioned futuristic plants that could produce higher yields and suck up more carbon.

[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=240s)

They saw it as a way to feed the world's growing population, not by expanding farms or using more fertilizer, but by improving the fundamental nature of plants. On the other hand, billions of years of  evolution hadn't fixed RuBisCO's problems, and neither had decades of scientific research.

[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=260s)

The lack of progress seems so hopeless that one source actually told me that scientists are sometimes a little hesitant to even admit they're working on this challenge. But not every one sees it that way. Look, I'm not going to be kink shamed on  RuBisCO, all right? This is Robbie Wilson, a self-described Rubiscologist at MIT.

[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=281s)

And he's one of the scientists that sees this evolutionary paradox as more of a challenge. Robbie is part of an international collaboration aimed at evolving a better RuBisCO, not in a field, or even a  greenhouse, but in a petri dish of bacteria. Typically, evolution takes place over millions of years.

[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=305s)

But scientists are able to speed this process up in bacteria for a few reasons. Bacteria are pretty simple to genetically engineer, meaning scientists can actually design their own sequences instead of waiting for random mutations. And their generations are only about 25 minutes long. I'd say it makes it a million times better, maybe a billion times easier to work with the bacteria.

[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=330s)

And this is what's so special about Robbie's technique: he's found a way to engineer bacteria to create and test thousands of different versions of RuBisCO in the lab. Just like in the wild, where threats like predators and disease push species to develop certain strengths, Robbie has designed a special lab environment to push the bacteria to develop better forms of RuBisCO.&#x20;

[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=356s)

Once each bacteria colony has produced  a slightly different version of RuBisCO,   Robbie and his team essentially poison the bacteria. The poison comes from a second enzyme, called PRK. Like RuBisCO, this enzyme is also an important part of photosynthesis in plants. In nature, PRK produces a chemical  that RuBisCO needs in order to do its job: capturing carbon and turning it into food.

[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=386s)

But in this petri dish, that same chemical can be deadly. The bacteria isn't designed for photosynthesis, so unless RuBisCO acts quickly, that chemical will just build up until it eventually kills the bacteria. RuBisCO is essentially an antidote to this poison, and the better  the RuBisCO, the healthier the bacteria.&#x20;

[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=412s)

Look at these two petri dishes from Robbie's  experiment. The first is full of bacteria that   contains RuBisCO like you'd find in nature. It's not very good, so you can't see any colonies. But here, on the right, the bacteria all have new versions of RuBisCO.

[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=430s)

You see all those red dots? Those are bacteria colonies that are  surviving because their new RuBisCO enzymes work really well. What you're seeing is evolution,  just happening in hours instead of millions of years. Once they've identified the best candidates in the petri dish — That's a big one! They need to see if they actually work in real plants.

[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=455s)

Using a syringe, they inject the new DNA into plants. You can actually see the liquid  spreading through the leaf. Those plants will go on to produce the brand new versions of RuBisCO, and Robbie's team will see if they actually do grow better in the real world. While it's still a long process from the lab to the field, Robbie is hoping that this project might finally demonstrate that a better RuBisCO actually is possible.

[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=483s)

I'm secretly pretty confident that we're going to change the way that people think about RuBisCO's  engineering potential, which is going to have a huge knock-on effect for continuing research. But as important as improving RuBisCO is, it's just one part of the enormous effort to develop more productive and climate-resilient crops.

[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=503s)

There's ideas to make plants that can capture more colors of the sunlight, or projects building on the natural workarounds that certain plants have  developed to circumvent RuBisCO's weaknesses. There have been very encouraging results from many other projects that have gotten me really excited.

[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined\&t=519s)

And I think if these can be combined together, we're going to have something really special
