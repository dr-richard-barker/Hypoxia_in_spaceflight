### Introduction: **Carbonic Anhydrase: Role and Implications**

Carbonic anhydrase (CA; carbonate hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.1) is a zinc-containing enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide:

\[ CO2 + H\_2O \ -> HCO\_3^- + H^+ ]

All known carbonic anhydrases in the animal kingdom are of the alpha type. There are seven mammalian CA isozymes (CA I-VII), each with distinct tissue distributions and intracellular locations. These enzymes are targets for drugs such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, and dichlorphenamide for treating glaucoma. There are three evolutionarily unrelated CA families: alpha, beta, and gamma.

**Physiological Role**

Carbonic anhydrases catalyze the critical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into bicarbonate (HCO3−) and protons (H+). They play a vital role in various physiological processes, including the rapid buffering of H+ within compartments, stabilizing pH-sensitive processes, and facilitating the movement of H+, CO2, HCO3−, and related species between compartments, which is essential for respiration, digestion, and pH regulation.

**Effects of Elevated CO2 on Plants**

On Earth, elevated CO2 levels have been shown to impact plant physiology, including enhanced photosynthesis and altered stomatal response. The stomatal opening, which regulates gas exchange and water loss, generally decreases under elevated CO2, improving water use efficiency. However, these responses can vary based on the species and environmental conditions.

**Challenges and Opportunities in Space Flight**

Studying the stomatal response of plants to elevated CO2 in space presents unique challenges and opportunities:

* **Lack of Convective Mixing:** Space environments lack the convective mixing of gases found on Earth, potentially affecting gas diffusion and making it challenging to simulate natural conditions.
* **Increased Ionizing Radiation:** Spaceflight-related stressors, such as increased ionizing radiation, may alter stomatal behavior differently than on Earth.

These conditions offer a unique environment to investigate how plants adapt to stressors and may inform future biological research and space agriculture initiatives.

### Does Microgravity causes elevated internal CO₂ and is this compounded by elevated CO2 levels on the ISS?&#x20;

Is the ISS atmospheric CO2 content high enough to influence this stomal function?

### Stomatal Behavior and Guard Cells

Under elevated CO₂ conditions, stomata tend to close to reduce water loss through transpiration. This response is mediated by guard cells, which regulate the opening and closing of stomata. High CO₂ levels lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, which play a crucial role in stomatal closure. In microgravity, the lack of convective mixing of gases can exacerbate the accumulation of CO₂ around the leaves, further promoting stomatal closure.

### Transpiration Stream and Vascular Transport

Transpiration is the process by which water is transported from the roots to the leaves and then evaporated into the atmosphere through stomata. In microgravity, the suppression of free air convection can reduce transpiration rates, leading to a buildup of water vapour around the leaves. This can affect the transpiration stream and the efficiency of water and nutrient transport through the plant's vascular system.

### Photorespiration and Anaerobic Respiration

Elevated CO₂ levels can inhibit photorespiration, a process where oxygen is consumed and CO₂ is released in the presence of light. In microgravity, the reduced gas exchange can lead to higher internal CO₂ concentrations, potentially causing a shift towards anaerobic respiration if oxygen levels become limiting. This shift can result in the accumulation of byproducts such as ethanol and lactate.

### Influence of Shoot-Derived Chemicals on Roots and Apoplastic pH

### Chemical Signaling

Chemicals produced in the shoots, such as phytohormones (e.g., sugars, abscisic acid, auxins, gibberellins and cytokinins and amino acids), can travel to the roots and influence their growth and function. One examples is that ABA produced in response to high CO₂ levels can signal the roots to adjust their water uptake and transport processes **(Ref)**. This signalling is crucial for maintaining water balance and nutrient uptake under varying environmental conditions. Additionally, auxins can modulate root architecture and growth patterns, further influencing the plant's ability to adapt to elevated CO₂ levels.

### Apoplastic pH

The apoplast is the network of cell walls and intercellular spaces through which water and solutes move. Changes in the chemical composition of the shoots can alter the pH of the apoplast, affecting nutrient availability and uptake in the roots. For example, an increase in CO₂ can lead to the acidification of the apoplast, influencing the solubility and transport of nutrients such as iron and phosphorus (Ref). This acidification can also affect the activity of cell wall-modifying enzymes and transport proteins, thereby impacting overall root function and growth. There are numerous papers that report that spaceflight changes cell walls (**Reference series)** all of which potentially are required changes in apoplastic pH and could be considered as a symptom of spaceflight-induced acidosis.&#x20;

### Role of ROS in Stomatal Closure

The genome ontology group known as the "Highlight Response " was response detected as the core spaceflight response in etiolated seedling in the BRIC19 experiment **Choi et al., (Ref)**. This reactive oxygen species signalling system is employed by plants during times of high photo flux to redistribute energy from the light harvesting complexes in the chloroplasts.  This may affect different cell types in different ways, in roots, it could affect the gravity-sensing machinery that is coordinated by statolith/amyloplast sedimentation. While in leaves, this spaceflight-induced highlight response could be indicative in changes in stomatal conductance. &#x20;

### ROS Production and Signaling

Under elevated CO₂ (eCO₂) conditions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) are produced in guard cells. This production is mediated by enzymes like NADPH oxidases (also known as Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs, RBOHs) and cell wall peroxidases. These ROS act as signalling molecules that initiate a cascade of events leading to stomatal closure.

### Activation of Ion Channels

ROS influence the activity of various ion channels in the guard cell plasma membrane. For instance, ROS can activate calcium (Ca²⁺) channels, leading to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ concentration. The elevated Ca²⁺ levels activate multiple kinases, which regulate the activity of ROS-producing enzymes and other ion channels. This results in the efflux of anions (e.g., chloride and malate) and potassium ions (K⁺) from the guard cells, causing a loss of turgor pressure and stomatal closure.

### Hormonal Interactions

Abscisic acid (ABA), a plant hormone, is known to enhance ROS production in guard cells. ABA signalling involves redox regulation, where ROS serve as key mediators. For example, ABA can activate NADPH oxidases, leading to increased ROS levels and subsequent stomatal closure. Salicylic acid (SA) is also required for eCO₂-induced ROS generation and stomatal closure, highlighting the complex interplay between different hormonal pathways in response to elevated CO₂.

### ABA signalling interacts with rapid ROS response feedback mechanisms

There is evidence of a positive feedback loop where increased ROS levels can enhance ABA accumulation, and increased ABA can further stimulate ROS production. This feedback loop helps to amplify the stomatal closure response under high CO₂ conditions. This mechanism ensures a robust and efficient response to environmental changes, optimizing water use and gas exchange.

### &#x20;Conclusion

Under elevated CO₂ conditions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in guard cells through the action of NADPH oxidases and cell wall peroxidases. These ROS act as signalling molecules that activate ion channels, leading to changes in ion fluxes and a decrease in guard cell turgor pressure, ultimately resulting in stomatal closure. Hormones like abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) play significant roles in modulating ROS production and the stomatal response, creating a complex regulatory network that ensures efficient stomatal closure. Elevated CO₂ levels in plant leaves under microgravity conditions can lead to significant physiological changes, including altered stomatal behaviour, reduced transpiration, and shifts in metabolic pathways. These changes might drive plants to adopt mechanisms to optimize CO₂ fixation and water use. Additionally, shoot-derived chemicals can influence root function and apoplastic pH, further affecting overall plant health and growth. Understanding these complex interactions is crucial for optimizing plant growth in space environments.
