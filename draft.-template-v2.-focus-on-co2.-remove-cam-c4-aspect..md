* NCBIRole of Carbonic Anhydrases and Inhibitors in Acid‚ÄìBase PhysiologyCarbonic anhydrases (CAs) catalyze a reaction fundamental for life: the bidirectional conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into bicarbonate (HCO3‚àí) and protons (H+). These enzymes impact numerous physiological processes that occur within and across the many compartments in the body. Within compartments, CAs promote rapid H+ buffering and thus the stability of pH-sensitive processes. Between compartments, CAs promote movements of H+, CO2, HCO3‚àí, and related species. This traffic is central to respiration, digestion, and whole-body/cellular pH regulation.

### Does Microgravity causes elevated internal CO‚ÇÇ and is this compounded by elevated CO2 levels on the ISS?&#x20;

Is the ISS atmospheric CO2 content high enough to influence this stomal function?

### Stomatal Behavior and Guard Cells

Under elevated CO‚ÇÇ conditions, stomata tend to close to reduce water loss through transpiration. This response is mediated by guard cells, which regulate the opening and closing of stomata. High CO‚ÇÇ levels lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, which play a crucial role in stomatal closure. In microgravity, the lack of convective mixing of gases can exacerbate the accumulation of CO‚ÇÇ around the leaves, further promoting stomatal closure.

### Transpiration Stream and Vascular Transport

Transpiration is the process by which water is transported from the roots to the leaves and then evaporated into the atmosphere through stomata. In microgravity, the suppression of free air convection can reduce transpiration rates, leading to a buildup of water vapor around the leaves. This can affect the transpiration stream and the efficiency of water and nutrient transport through the plant's vascular system.

### Photorespiration and Anaerobic Respiration

Elevated CO‚ÇÇ levels can inhibit photorespiration, a process where oxygen is consumed and CO‚ÇÇ is released in the presence of light. In microgravity, the reduced gas exchange can lead to higher internal CO‚ÇÇ concentrations, potentially causing a shift towards anaerobic respiration if oxygen levels become limiting. This shift can result in the accumulation of byproducts such as ethanol and lactate.

### Influence of Shoot-Derived Chemicals on Roots and Apoplastic pH

### Chemical Signaling

Chemicals produced in the shoots, such as phytohormones (e.g., abscisic acid (ABA), auxins), can travel to the roots and influence their growth and function. For instance, ABA produced in response to high CO‚ÇÇ levels can signal the roots to adjust their water uptake and transport processes. This signaling is crucial for maintaining water balance and nutrient uptake under varying environmental conditions. Additionally, auxins can modulate root architecture and growth patterns, further influencing the plant's ability to adapt to elevated CO‚ÇÇ levels.

### Apoplastic pH

The apoplast is the network of cell walls and intercellular spaces through which water and solutes move. Changes in the chemical composition of the shoots can alter the pH of the apoplast, affecting nutrient availability and uptake in the roots. For example, an increase in CO‚ÇÇ can lead to the acidification of the apoplast, influencing the solubility and transport of nutrients such as iron and phosphorus. This acidification can also affect the activity of cell wall-modifying enzymes and transport proteins, thereby impacting overall root function and growth.

### Role of ROS in Stomatal Closure

### ROS Production and Signaling

Under elevated CO‚ÇÇ (eCO‚ÇÇ) conditions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ) are produced in guard cells. This production is mediated by enzymes like NADPH oxidases (also known as Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs, RBOHs) and cell wall peroxidases. These ROS act as signaling molecules that initiate a cascade of events leading to stomatal closure.

### Activation of Ion Channels

ROS influence the activity of various ion channels in the guard cell plasma membrane. For instance, ROS can activate calcium (Ca¬≤‚Å∫) channels, leading to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca¬≤‚Å∫ concentration. The elevated Ca¬≤‚Å∫ levels activate multiple kinases, which regulate the activity of ROS-producing enzymes and other ion channels. This results in the efflux of anions (e.g., chloride and malate) and potassium ions (K‚Å∫) from the guard cells, causing a loss of turgor pressure and stomatal closure.

### Hormonal Interactions

Abscisic acid (ABA), a plant hormone, is known to enhance ROS production in guard cells. ABA signaling involves redox regulation, where ROS serve as key mediators. For example, ABA can activate NADPH oxidases, leading to increased ROS levels and subsequent stomatal closure. Salicylic acid (SA) is also required for eCO‚ÇÇ-induced ROS generation and stomatal closure, highlighting the complex interplay between different hormonal pathways in response to elevated CO‚ÇÇ.

### Feedback Mechanisms

There is evidence of a positive feedback loop where increased ROS levels can enhance ABA accumulation, and increased ABA can further stimulate ROS production. This feedback loop helps to amplify the stomatal closure response under high CO‚ÇÇ conditions. This mechanism ensures a robust and efficient response to environmental changes, optimizing water use and gas exchange.

### &#x20;Conclusion

Under elevated CO‚ÇÇ conditions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in guard cells through the action of NADPH oxidases and cell wall peroxidases. These ROS act as signaling molecules that activate ion channels, leading to changes in ion fluxes and a decrease in guard cell turgor pressure, ultimately resulting in stomatal closure. Hormones like abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) play significant roles in modulating ROS production and the stomatal response, creating a complex regulatory network that ensures efficient stomatal closure. Elevated CO‚ÇÇ levels in plant leaves under microgravity conditions can lead to significant physiological changes, including altered stomatal behavior, reduced transpiration, and shifts in metabolic pathways. These changes might drive plants to adopt mechanisms to optimize CO‚ÇÇ fixation and water use. Additionally, shoot-derived chemicals can influence root function and apoplastic pH, further affecting overall plant health and growth. Understanding these complex interactions is crucial for optimizing plant growth in space environments.
