# Systems of Photosynthesis

### C3 photosynthesis

C4 and CAM plants have developed strategies to minimize photorespiration. CAM plants and C3-C4 intermediates use a two-stage strategy to keep CO2 levels high and oxygen levels low in the chloroplasts where the Calvin cycle occurs. C4 plants initially fix CO2 into a four-carbon compound, which is later converted to CO2 to enter the Calvin cycle. This helps prevent rubisco from binding with oxygen instead of CO2, which would be wasteful of the captured light energy and reduce the enzyme's efficiency.

Approximately 85% of plant species, including cereal grains like wheat, rice, barley, and oats, as well as peanuts, cotton, sugar beets, tobacco, spinach, soybeans, and most trees, are C3 plants. Most lawn grasses, such as rye and fescue, are also C3 plants. In hot and dry conditions, C3 plants face reduced photosynthetic efficiency due to photorespiration, which occurs when CO2 levels drop below 50 ppm.

C3 plants rely on an electron transport process involving the thylakoid membranes for non-cyclic electron transport. The light energy captured by the chloroplasts ultimately produces two 3-carbon molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA), giving rise to the designation of C3 plants in the literature.

### C4 photosynthesis

The C4 pathway involves pumping 4-carbon acids to the bundle sheath cell and recycling a 3-carbon compound back to the mesophyll cell for conversion to PEP. This energy loss is why C3 plants outperform C4 plants with ample water and sunlight. However, C4 plants, by optimally using rubisco, regain some energy. According to Moore et al., only around 0.4% of the 260,000 known plant species are C4, but this small group includes important crops like corn, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet, as well as tropical grasses.

C4 photosynthesis reduces the effects of photorespiration by maintaining high CO2 concentrations and minimizing oxygen presence, enhancing the efficiency of rubisco. The two-stage process actively pumps carbon, creating an environment with 10-120 times more CO2 available for the Calvin cycle. This results in the production of G3P, which is converted into sucrose, starch, and other carbohydrates in the chloroplast.

The C4 pathway starts with CO2 fixation in mesophyll cells, forming a 4-carbon intermediate (malate), which then moves to bundle sheath cells. Here, it releases CO2 to enter the Calvin cycle. C4 plants rarely saturate with light and outperform C3 plants under hot, dry conditions. Sugarcane, a C4 plant, is highly efficient in photosynthesis, reaching rates up to 7%.



## C3-C4 Intermediate Photosynthesis

In conditions where oxygen is fixed instead of CO2, photosynthesis is reversed. C4 plants protect their rubisco from oxygen, allowing them to function at near-zero CO2 levels without triggering photorespiration. The diagram on the right shows CO2 compensation points for three plant typesâ€”the levels where net photosynthesis stops. In hot, dry conditions, plants close their stomata to conserve moisture, drastically reducing CO2 from the atmospheric level of around 380 ppm (2004 value). Lower CO2 compensation points mean these plants can thrive in hotter, drier conditions.

Studies by Moore et al. highlight genera like Flaveria (Asteraceae), Panicum (Poaceae), and Alternanthera (Amaranthaceae) as intermediates between C3 and C4 photosynthesis. These intermediates feature leaf anatomies with less distinct and developed bundle sheath cells compared to true C4 plants, allowing better adaptation to higher temperatures and drier environments.



CAM



## Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM)

Some plant varieties convert to C3 plants at the end of the day when their acid stores are depleted and water is sufficient. In CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) plants, processes are separated by time: CO2 fixation occurs at night, and the malic acid is used in the Calvin cycle during the day. With stomata open only at night, when temperatures are lower and humidity is higher, CAM plants use much less water than C4 plants. CAM plants are adapted to hot, dry environments, comprising about 10% of plant species, including cacti, orchids, and pineapples. Agriculturally significant CAM plants include pineapples and Agave species used for tequila and fiber. The term "Crassulacean Acid Metabolism" comes from the Crassulaceae family, where this strategy was first discovered. These plants take in CO2 at night, storing it as malic acid in vacuoles, which can drop the pH to 4 with a concentration of up to 0.3 M. During the day, stomata close to conserve water, and malic acid is decarboxylated to release CO2 for the Calvin cycle.
