### &#x20;"Enhancing C3 Crop Plant Adaptation to Elevated CO2 and Photorespiration in Spaceflight Environments through Carbon-Concentrating Mechanisms"

#### Abstract

* Brief overview of the challenges C3 crop plants face in spaceflight environments, including elevated CO₂ levels and increased photorespiration.
* Introduction to carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) in C4 and CAM plants.
* Purpose of the paper: to explore how these mechanisms can be adapted to improve the resilience and efficiency of C3 crops in space.

#### Introduction
