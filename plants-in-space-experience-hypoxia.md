Description of main aerobic respiration reactions/concepts

1\. Glycolysis, which takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell and converts glucose into pyruvate.

2\. Pyruvate oxidation, which takes place in the mitochondrial matrix and converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA.

3\. The Krebs cycle, which takes place in the mitochondrial matrix and produces ATP, CO2, and NADH.

4\. The electron transport chain, which takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane and converts NADH and FADH2 into ATP via oxidative phosphorylation.

**Hypoxia as a feature of spaceflight**

### Adaptation to anaerobic respiration

During periods of anaerobic respiration, the availability of oxygen is limited, which affects the electron transport chain in the mitochondria, the final stage of aerobic respiration. Without oxygen, the electron transport chain cannot function properly, leading to an accumulation of NADH and FADH2, which would typically be used in oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. As a result, glycolysis becomes the main source of ATP production through the conversion of glucose to pyruvate, as it can proceed in the absence of oxygen. However, in the absence of oxygen, pyruvate is not fully oxidized to CO2, and instead is converted to lactic acid or alcohol through fermentation, depending on the organism. Pyruvate oxidation and the Krebs cycle are also affected by the lack of oxygen, as they are dependent on the availability of oxygen to produce NADH and FADH2. Without oxygen, the Krebs cycle will not produce ATP, CO2, or NADH, and pyruvate oxidation will not be able to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.

### Energy from mitochondria helps plants take up minerals

The energy generated by the mitochondria in plants is used to power various processes, including the uptake of minerals from the soil. Specifically, the transport of minerals from the soil into plant roots is an active process that requires energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is produced by mitochondria during cellular respiration. The uptake of minerals by plant roots is accomplished through the action of specialized transport proteins embedded in the plasma membrane of root cells. These transporters use ATP to pump minerals against a concentration gradient, from the soil into the plant root cells. This is known as active transport, as it requires the input of energy to move molecules against their concentration gradient.

&#x20;

In addition to providing energy for active transport, mitochondria are also involved in the biosynthesis of various molecules that are important for the uptake and use of minerals in plants. For example, mitochondria are involved in the production of heme, which is a cofactor required for the function of many transporters involved in the uptake of iron and other metals. Mitochondria also produce various amino acids and organic acids that are important for mineral uptake and metabolism in plants. Overall, the energy generated by mitochondria plays a critical role in facilitating the uptake and utilization of minerals in plants, and without sufficient energy, plants would be unable to efficiently take up the nutrients they need to survive and grow.
